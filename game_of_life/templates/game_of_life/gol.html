                    The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

                        Well first of all I think it's really cool. You can spend hours playing with it. I also wanted to show potential employers that I can 
                        use Javascript which is both immensely popular and something I've hardly ever used.

                        Wow, what a good question Daniel. I'd have to say that efficiency was the biggest challenge. In my first iterations 
                        of coding this I was using multiple two dimensional arrays. One was for the current generation of cells, another was for 
                        the next generation, one was fortracking the cell's neighbor counts... there was a lot of looping. I ended up replacing 
                        all of those with a single three dimensional array.And then I used another 3D array to create a mapping of every cell 
                        with it's possible coordinates. Previously I had been calculating that on every loop. then I realized frontloading that 
                        work into an initial mapping would help greatly, which it did.I also coded this whole website on a Raspberry Pi 400,
                        so there was that limitation as well. (Yes I have better computers, but after workingat a Windows only job for 1.5 
                        years, I wanted to get back in touch with Linux).
