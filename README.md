# django_project
This is a little Django project I made a while ago. I had bought a Raspberry Pi 400 and wanted to do something with it since I hadn't used Linux in a while, and I also wanted to use Python.

The most fun part of this site is the Game of Life page.

The content of the site wasn't the point so much as the experience of making it and getting it hosted.
